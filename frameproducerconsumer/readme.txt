A library to access and manipulate images asynchronously
---------------------------------------------------------

In one application, I'd like to be able to obtain images from our scanner sequentially
and do things to them without holding up the scanner:

- display on the screen in a GUI, maybe in several displays
- save to file 
- analyze using image processing techniques and write out results

Can you write a small library or module, in C++, that allows me to do that? 

The user of the library would be responsible for all the functionality in terms of 
actual image manipulation or display. The library would provide an interface and 
underlying functionality for the asynchronous access. 

Submit your code and anything you'd like to provide to demonstrate that it
works as expected. Use any tooling you like. 

Example images*, should you want them, are in a TIFF format in the images/ folder. 
They can be read using OpenCV's imread() function, or your TIFF-reader of choice. 

Please return your submission by email to pvarshavskaya@rarecyte.com or through 
github (send me a link) within 48 hours. 

Feel free to ask any questions you have about this exercise.

*These are small. Actual images generated by our scanner will be ~42Mb each.
